# GSD SES5394 Team 1
This is a repository that contains team assignments for the GSD SES 5394 Travel Behavior & Forecasting course @ Harvard.

## Requirements
- **R (version 4.x or higher)**
- R packages: `tidyverse`, `sf`, `DBI`, `leaflet`, `tigris`, `ggplot2`, `tmap`
- TransCAD (for running the TDM23 model)

## Usage
To reproduce the analysis from these repos:
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anitej185/gsd-ses5394-team1.git
   cd gsd-ses5394-team1

## Assignments Overview:
1. T1: We explore a hypothetical scenario in which all academic buildings, athletic fields, and green spaces on the Harvard and MIT campuses are replaced with affordable housing units. Student dormitories remain unchanged. Under this scenario, thousands of transit-accessible jobs are removed, which may alter local transportation patterns, household vehicle ownership, and transit demand. Our analysis uses R and TransCAD to process and visualize the resulting changes in vehicle availability. Within the T1 folder are the following files:
   - `T1_FINAL.qmd` contains our code
   - `/blocks` folder contains the output geospatial files for the target blocks (associated with the five census tracts that we targeted) and the dif (changes from the base to the alternative model)
